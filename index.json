I recently graduated with the degree of Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering from National Institute of Technology Durgapur, India. My research interest lies in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. Recently, I have been interested in the emerging areas of Interpretable Machine Learning and Adversarial Machine Learning. I am also exploring the Optimization Foundations of Machine Learning, Representation Learning and Reinforcement Learning as well as Decision-Making under Uncertainty.\nDuring the summer of 2018, I was a research intern under Professor Antonio M. Lopez working in the ADAS Group at the Computer Vision Center (CVC) Barcelona, Spain. I have also worked with Professor Umapada Pal at the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Unit, Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://mukherjeesohom.github.io/author/sohom-mukherjee/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/sohom-mukherjee/","section":"authors","summary":"I am Sohom Mukherjee.
